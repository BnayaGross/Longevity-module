The files in this folder refer to the microscopic mechanism of interdependent superconducting networks studied in the article entitled "Network-driven discovery of repurposable drugs targeting hallmarks of aging".

The following folders are presented:
1. The folder "Proximity and pAGE results" contains the results of the algorithms and provides the Proximity and pAGE values for each drug to each hallmark of aging for every confidence level.
