This folder contains a demo to run the algorithm on a small set of drugs and calculate the pAGE value using synthetic data. The expected output can be found in the Output folder. The running time of the algorithm is a few minutes on a standard desktop computer.

Similarly to the main algorithm, the file "PPI_2022_distances.pkl" needs to be created and put in the data folder using the script "Create_PPI_2022_distances.ipynb". Description of the code and data can be found in the README.md file in the main folder.
